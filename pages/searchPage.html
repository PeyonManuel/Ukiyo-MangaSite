								His name is Guts, the Black Swordsman, a feared warrior spoken
								of only in whispers. Bearer of a gigantic sword, an iron hand,
								and the scars of countless battles and tortures, his flesh is
								also indelibly marked with The Brand, an unholy symbol that
								draws the forces of darkness to him and dooms him as their
								sacrifice. But Guts won't take his fate lying down; he'll cut a
								crimson swath of carnage through the ranks of the damned—and
								anyone else foolish enough to oppose him! Accompanied by Puck
								the Elf, more an annoyance than a companion, Guts relentlessly
								follows a dark, bloodstained path that leads only to death...or
								vengeance.

								As a child, Monkey D. Luffy was inspired to become a pirate by
								listening to the tales of the buccaneer "Red-Haired" Shanks. But
								his life changed when Luffy accidentally ate the Gum-Gum Devil
								Fruit and gained the power to stretch like rubber...at the cost
								of never being able to swim again! Years later, still vowing to
								become the king of the pirates, Luffy sets out on his
								adventure...one guy alone in a rowboat, in search of the
								legendary "One Piece," said to be the greatest treasure in the
								world...

								Originally presented as an unrelated story, this series was
								later officially declared a part of the JoJo storyline. The
								series stars Gyro Zeppeli, who uses a set of steel balls that
								spin incredibly fast, and Johnny Joestar (Jonathan Joestar), a
								former hot-shot jockey who was crippled by an ambusher and lost
								his fame and fortune. They race, along with others, in a
								mad-dash across America for 50 million dollars, reminiscent of
								The Cannonball Run.

								At seventeen years of age, Miyamoto Musashi--still known by his
								childhood name, Shinmen Takezo--was a wild young brute just
								setting out along the way of the sword. In the aftermath of the
								epic Battle of Sekigahara, Takezo finds himself a fugitive
								survivor on the losing side of the war. Takezo's vicious nature
								has made him an outcast even in his own village, and he is
								hunted down like an animal. At this crucial crossroads in
								Takezo's life, an eccentric monk and a childhood friend are the
								only ones who can help him find his way.

								Everyone faces uncertainty at some point in their lives. Even a
								brilliant surgeon like Kenzo Tenma is no exception. But there’s
								no way he could have known that his decision to stop chasing
								professional success and instead concentrate on his oath to save
								peoples’ lives would result in the birth of an abomination. The
								questions of good and evil now take on a terrifyingly real
								dimension. Years later, in Germany during the tumultuous
								post-reunification period, middle-aged childless couples are
								being killed one after another. The serial killer’s identity is
								known. The reasons why he kills are not. Dr. Tenma sets out on a
								journey to find the killer’s twin sister, who may hold some
								clues to solving the enigma of the “Monster.”
